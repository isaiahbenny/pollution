# Which Year Had the Most Deaths?

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
```


```{r}
pollution <- read_csv("ny_pollution.csv.gz")

death_by_year <- pollution %>% group_by(Year = year(date)) %>% 
  summarize(Deaths = sum(death)) %>% arrange(desc(Deaths))

kable(death_by_year[1,])
```

# Supporting Premise

To support this conclusion, I will produce a graph showing the number of deaths for each year.

```{r}
ggplot(death_by_year) + aes(x=Year,y=Deaths) + geom_col() + 
  ggtitle("Number of Deaths by Year") + geom_hline(yintercept = max(death_by_year$Deaths))
```
